# nibm
A non-interactive boot manager

Requirements:
	no gui
	no user i/o
	no extra effort for 32bit support
	usable from default EFI location
	usable with SecureBoot
	suckless file list (main.c, main.h, config.h, Makefile)
	suckless configuration (recompile)

Questions:
	Can a shell script be executed, and execution of chains resume?
	What to do with failed actions? Stop the chain?

RulesList:
	Array of Chains
	Executed in order
	Chain execution stops on loading an external app

Chain:
	Array of triggers and actions
	Executed in order
	Triggers are not necessary
		A failed trigger ceases operation of the Chain
		A Chain with no triggers will attempt to execute all actions
	Actions are not necessary
		But a Chain with no actions has no effect
		A failed action ceases operation of the Chain

Triggers:
	Mountable Device detection
	File detection
	Other hardware device detection

Actions:
	Load efi binary
	Load linux kernel
	Run efi shell script (is this a subset of load binary?)
	Verify signature

Keys:
	Map of keys to use for signature verification
